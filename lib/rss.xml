 <br><br>This is my... Third... attempt at an Obsidian vault. I'm planning on using this vault JUST for notes, without worrying about how it looks in the graph view, and I'll be attempting to NOT delete files. If I do, it's - hopefully - for good reason.<br>This page will (if the dataview code works) link to every MOC that links to here, pretty much making traversal through this vast ocean of crappy notes and even worse attempts at organisation, slightly more bearable. I'll attempt to keep notes on every project I work on, while also using this vault as a testing grounds for an app I'm working on, which will hopefully make organisation a bit easier (no, I do not know how it'll work, all I know is that it'll hopefully go off of the existing Markdown Notes).<br><br>]]></description><link>00-maps-of-content/yggdrasil.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">00 - Maps of Content/Yggdrasil.md</guid><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 04:23:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Files linking to Coding MOC]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br><br><br><br>Immortal temptation<br>
Takes over my mind, condemned<br>
Falling weak on my knees<br>
Summon the strength of mayhem<br>I am the storm that is approaching<br>
Provoking black clouds in isolation<br>
I am reclaimer of my name<br>
Born in flames, I have been blessed<br>
My family crest is a demon of death<br>
Forsakened, I am awakened<br>
A phoenix's ash in dark divine<br>
Descending misery<br>
Destiny chasing time<br>Inherit the nightmare, surrounded by fate<br>
Can't run away<br>
Keep walking the line, between the light<br>
Led astray<br>Through vacant halls I won't surrender<br>
The truth revealed in eyes of ember<br>
We fight through fire and ice forever<br>
Two souls once lost, and now they remember<br>I am the storm that is approaching<br>
Provoking black clouds in isolation<br>
I am reclaimer of my name<br>
Born in flames, I have been blessed<br>
My family crest is a demon of death<br>
Forsakened, I am awakened<br>
A phoenix's ash in dark divine<br>
Descending misery<br>
Destiny chasing time<br>Disappear into the night<br>
Lost shadows left behind<br>
Obsession's pulling me<br>
Fading, I've come to take what's mine<br>Lurking in the shadows under veil of night<br>
Constellations of blood pirouette<br>
Dancing through the graves of those who stand at my feet<br>
Dreams of the black throne I keep on repeat<br>
A derelict of dark, summoned from the ashes<br>
The puppet master congregates all the masses<br>
Pulling strings, twisting minds as blades hit<br>
You want this power? Then come try and take it<br>Beyond the tree, fire burns<br>
Secret love, bloodline yearns<br>
Dark minds embrace, crimson joy<br>
Does your dim heart heal or destroy?<br>Bury the light deep within<br>
Cast aside, there's no coming home<br>
We're burning chaos in the wind<br>
Drifting in the ocean all alone<br><br><br>So, here, we have a broken character - <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Vergil - DMC" data-href="Vergil - DMC" href="03-areas/01-games/01-devil-may-cry/02-characters/vergil-dmc.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Vergil</a>, in this case - with his very own theme song which puts on a show of his own power while exploring how he is broken mentally. It may seem like a simple song, but when you analyse both the song and the character, it becomes much deeper in both meaning and symbolism, while also rooting Vergil as this character who has been destroyed and is now rebuilding himself while portraying someone different. <br><br>In his childhood, Vergil's family was - to his belief - murdered by Demons, which was almost right after his father - <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Sparda - DMC" data-href="Sparda - DMC" href="03-areas/01-games/01-devil-may-cry/02-characters/sparda-dmc.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Sparda</a> - disappeared. During this, he was stabbed by the sword his father gave him, and made to feel weak, and, born out of desperation and a last ditch effort, his demon heritage activated for the first time and saved him. Through this act, he blamed his humanity and himself, for the death of his mother, and the supposed death of his brother - <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Dante - DMC" data-href="Dante - DMC" href="03-areas/01-games/01-devil-may-cry/02-characters/dante-dmc.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dante</a> - seeking more and more power, and causing his inferiority complex that continues to haunt him throughout all of the series, right up until the end of Devil May Cry 5. This tragedy parallels Dante's experience, where his mothers last act was to save him, before the demons killed her, leading Dante to blame his demonic heritage entirely for the death of his mother. While Vergil continued to gain power through his demon half, Dante gained power through his human half and his humanity, leading to one of Dante's more complex themes, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Devils Never Cry - Analysis" data-href="Devils Never Cry - Analysis" href="03-areas/01-games/01-devil-may-cry/01-songs/devils-never-cry-analysis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Devils Never Cry</a>.<br>In Devil May Cry 3, Dante and Vergil had found out both of them were alive, where Vergil 'lovingly' stabbed Dante, causing Dante's demon blood to activate, meaning both of the Sons of Sparda now have accessed their Devil Trigger. Throughout the remainder of this game, we see how the Sons of Sparda fight over their differences, and, towards the end, even work together to defeat a common enemy. Despite this, Vergil, heavily overestimating his power, casts himself to Hell to attempt to defeat the Demon who killed his family - Mundus. <br>Despite his beliefs, Vergil failed to defeat Mundus, and was instead captured and tortured for years on end - his heart ripped out, his mind controlled, his body destroyed. After enough time, Vergil was fully controlled, and made into the puppet Nelo Angelo, forced to do as Mundus asked. It was only through Dante that once more did Vergil return, however, Vergil's return was unknown to him, with Dante having believed Vergil to be dead. Due to this, Dante entered into a state of depression through the events of Devil May Cry 2 and the Devil May Cry anime.<br>After Devil May Cry 1's events took place, Vergil's body was crumbling, collapsing on itself as it struggled to survive, holding itself together with what little power was left. This left Vergil with one option - to reclaim the Yamato, the sword his father gave him, shattered and left in Fortuna until a man with a demonic arm absorbed the sword and repaired it. One month before Devil May Cry 5 took place, Vergil ripped the mans - Nero, Vergil's son, unknown by everyone except Dante - arm cleanly off, leaving Nero on the ground bleeding. Using the Yamato, Vergil split himself in two, separating his weakness - his humanity - from what he believed to be his strength - his demon blood - releasing V, the frail, slowly crumbling human, and Urizen, a demon of unprecedented power. However, this did not last long - only two months, in fact - where, due to V and Urizen's imminent deaths, they were required to remerge back into Vergil.<br><br><br>Using what we now know of Vergil, we can start delving into the complexities of his theme. In the first line, "Immortal temptation" refers to Vergil's lust for power, due to what happened to his family all those years ago, with it taking over his mind, being the only thing he cares for, condemning him to suffering. Due to this suffering, he is forced to summon the strength of mayhem - mayhem being something we see referenced multiple times throughout this song, alluding to destruction and misery - merely to survive and to not feel weak. Here, we come to the first chorus.<br>In this chorus, the mask Vergil wears begins to slip - the calm, concentrated person we see falters back into a being of destruction and chaos. We can see the entire chorus as a display of power, as a display of Vergil's full strength, an act of intimidation, and we can also see its other interpretation, a display of pain and suffering, of misery and mayhem. "I am the storm that is approaching" is Vergil acknowledging everything he has done has led to destruction, using a storm as a symbol for this destruction. The next line is a continuation of the same symbolism, however, also showing that Vergil believes he is alone, that he isolated - "Black clouds in isolation". Vergil may be a villain, but he is one that this chorus alone will make you sympathise for due to the tragic nature of his story. Now, Vergil being the reclaimer of his name is a line that can be interpreted, like almost all the song, in multiple ways - he is ashamed of himself, for being controlled, for being weak, for not saving his family, or, he is reclaiming his families name, the one sullied by the disappearance of his father, and the failure of his brother. I prefer the first interpretation for this song in particular, as it works well with the chorus, it continues the display of both power, and Vergil's pain, alongside his misery. With the line "Born in flames", this a reference to both his rebirth in the climax of Devil May Cry 5, and also where he believes the person he is now began - way back when he was a child, trapped in that graveyard with the Yamato stabbed through his body, the same moment his inferiority complex began, the same moment his family was killed, and the new Vergil was reborn. In the very next line, Vergil once more shows the absolute honour he has for his family, and the knowledge he has of his fathers past life - being a demon who killed thousands if not millions of other demons - believing his father to be the true family crest. With Vergil being awakened, it is most likely in reference to his realisation he cannot gain more power through relying purely on his demonic heritage, and that - like Dante embracing his demon half - he must embrace both halves of his heritage to gain more power, unlocking his Sin Devil Trigger in the process. Here we come to yet another line likening Vergil to a phoenix, being a phoenix's ash; however, this is merely likening him to the ash, not to the phoenix itself, likening him more to the fact that he WILL rise again, as he has done before - his death as Nelo Angelo in Devil May Cry 1, him being mind controlled into Nelo Angelo in Devil May Cry 3, and now, him returning from having being split into two in Devil May Cry 5. With "descending misery", we once again see a likening of Vergil to a natural disaster, the storm having caused misery upon all that have been affected, the mere approach being the destiny that is chasing. Focusing more on that line of "destiny chasing time", what does it mean for Vergil? More than likely it means that Vergil believes him to have some sort of... glorious purpose yet to be fulfilled, some sort of destiny that the Son of Sparda has yet to achieve, merely limited by time.<br>Alright, apologies for the word vomit. It's a long chorus, and my favourite of all time due to the meanings behind it, and because it sounds cool as hell. Now, on to one of my favourite verses of all time. In the first line, "Inherit the nightmare, surrounded by fate", we see a combination of Vergil's despair, and his acceptance of it. "Inherit the nightmare" more than likely refers to Nightmare from Devil May Cry 1, a beast capable of destroying the infinite dimension of Hell, while being "surrounded by fate" would - going off of this interpretation - Vergil's body and mind being controlled by Mundus, and his acceptance of this. The song then states he "Can't run away", acting as a continuation of the previous line, where Vergil is unable to run away from the darkness - the Nightmare, if you will - surrounding him, and corrupting his fate more and more. Through this corruption, Vergil is forced to "Keep walking the line, between the light", the darkness consuming him entirely, believing all good in himself to be lost to that same corruption, being led astray from the fate he once had until his father disappeared. Now, we come to Vergil's resilience, his want to return to the light - and to the person who he believes can save him, who can bring him back from the corruption, return Vergil to this glorious purpose he seems set on.<br>This chorus is another display of power, and of Vergil's motivation to keep growing, and to keep returning back when he is lost. In the line "Through vacant halls I won't surrender", we know he is fighting, but for what? For himself? To see if he is worthy of being saved? Well, with the three words "eyes of ember", we return ourselves to the sibling rivalry between Vergil and Dante - Vergil being the cold, calculated one, almost like ice, and Dante being the explosive, somewhat destructive one, akin to a burning flame - the truth being revealed is what Vergil is looking for, something that can save him, or more accurately, someone who can save him. The next line continues this, Vergil and Dante's never-ending rivalry being stated as such, fighting each other forever, fighting through the fire and ice. This is what has saved both of them. Once, Dante was lost, after his belief that he killed his own brother again, and knowing Vergil is alive returned him, allowed him to remember not just the rivalry, but the brothership they share. Vergil, however, was once completely lost to Mundus, not in control of even his own mind, trapped inside himself, and because of his brother, he was able to return from death itself. Yet, once more, we return to William Blake's love for double meanings, this one line can also be interpreted as V and Urizen remerging back into one complete being, remerging back into Vergil, remembering everything, gaining more power, reclaiming himself.<br>Through vacant halls I won't surrender<br>

 <br><br>To create an app which functions as a heatmap using Obsidian tags and date created dates as reference. These created dates will be able to be manually modified if necessary, and stored in the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Clippings/Obsidian/Properties - Obsidian Help" data-href="Clippings/Obsidian/Properties - Obsidian Help" href="clippings/obsidian/properties-obsidian-help.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">files YAML</a>. This will allow the user to fix incorrect dates for their files if they are using a sync app such as Syncthing or Obsidian Sync. This will function similarly to GitHub's heatmap as shown below.<br>
<img alt="99 - Meta/Pasted image 20250103124551.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20250103124551.png"><br>One main difference between this and the project I intend to create, however, is that different tags will have different colours (i.e., Study may have the blue colour, or the Media tag might have the red colour), which will change strength based on the amount edited, with the user being able to change what amount is necessary for maximum strength. The user will also be able to choose what tags will be displayed, and with what colour. If possible, I will also add in a hex colour picker which will allow the user to have many more options for their code.<br><br>This goal will be achieved through multiple steps, which are as follow:<br>
<br>Creating a basic GUI screen with preset dates and tags in an Obsidian vault as proof of concept

<br>Tkinter - better file interaction
<br>Vault - TEST VAULT
<br>Preset Tags - Daily, Games, Coding
<br>Preset dates - 1/1/2024, 2/1/2024, 5/1/2024, 1/2/2024


<br>Updating this basic GUI screen to be able to read from a separate file for what tags to look for (this will most likely be limited to 4 tags for this step), most likely using similar code from the expense tracker program I have written in the past to write, then read, the tags and colours. This may eventually cause problems, however, it is probably the simplest solution for now.
<br>Giving the user preset options for colours per tag, and I will also increase the amount of tags able to be chosen.
<br>Adding in a hex colour chooser.
<br>Through these steps, I hope to achieve a project suitable to my original goal. After this project has been completed, it may continue to be worked on, perhaps even adding in more features as time goes on, such as a calendar which links to the monthly notes and takes the Daily Notes they link to. This project could also be improved upon by directly making it into a community plugin rather than a separate app, however, I am not sure about the coding language used for the community plugins,]]></description><link>03-areas/02-coding/01-projects/01-obsidian-heat-map/00-overview.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">03 - Areas/02 - Coding/01 - Projects/01 - Obsidian Heat Map/00 - Overview.md</guid><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 01:23:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="lib/media/pasted-image-20250103124551.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;lib/media/pasted-image-20250103124551.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Python - CSV]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br><br>Love and harmony combine,<br>
And round our souls entwine<br>
While thy branches mix with mine,<br>
And our roots together join.  <br>Joys upon our branches sit,<br>
Chirping loud and singing sweet;<br>
Like gentle streams beneath our feet<br>
Innocence and virtue meet.  <br>Thou the golden fruit dost bear,<br>
I am clad in flowers fair;<br>
Thy sweet boughs perfume the air,<br>
And the turtle buildeth there.  <br>There she sits and feeds her young,<br>
Sweet I hear her mournful song;<br>
And thy lovely leaves among,<br>
There is love, I hear his tongue.  <br>There his charming nest doth lay,<br>
There he sleeps the night away;<br>
There he sports along the day,<br>
And doth among our branches play.<br><br><br>
<br>branches

<br>the future
<br>"While thy branches mix with mine" could mean the connection of two peoples future


<br>roots

<br>the past, or something that can't be changed
<br>"our roots together join" could reference those two people joining their past, everything that's known about them coming together into one


<br>golden fruit

<br>the ideal future
<br>Joe Abercrombie: “The seeds of the past bear fruit in the present.”
<br>could have a sinister undertone (similar to the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Urizen - DMC5" data-href="Urizen - DMC5" href="03-areas/01-games/01-devil-may-cry/02-characters/urizen-dmc5.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Urizen</a> scene in Devil May Cry 5, where this poem is referenced multiple times), such as it leading to the destruction of this future

<br>is in line with Blake's other poems, since he believes every person has two sides - one good, one bad, including God - so this poem very well could have two sides to it




<br>"joys"

<br>children most likely
<br>

Right now, I will aim to update this once a week. If you notice gaps in my folders, that's because I excluded them. For my vault exporting, I use <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="obsidian://show-plugin?id=webpage-html-export" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="obsidian://show-plugin?id=webpage-html-export" target="_blank">this plugin</a>. If you have the time, check them out! I majorly recommend them.<br><br>I'm not one to put too much information about myself on the internet, but as of the 1st of January, 2025, here is what I use for Obsidian:<br>
<br>PC:

<br>Intel i5 4460s (yes, it's old) with the iGPU
<br>Samsung SyncMaster 713n
<br>aiwa Japan 1080p 75hz monitor
<br>Some Big W mouse, keyboard and mouse pad Avengers set
<br>Arch Linux (i use arch btw)
<br>KDE Plasma &amp; Hyprland (if you don't know what those are, don't worry)

<br>(speaking of Arch, i'm in the middle of making a tutorial on here for anyone who wants to use it, it's not uploaded yet tho)




<br>Obsidian:

<br>Webpage HTML Export (which I linked earlier, no I won't link every plugin here)
<br>Dataview (if you use Obsidian, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE use this)
<br>Excalidraw (not overly useful, but has its niches)
<br>Calendar (who the hell doesn't use a calendar)
<br>Spaced Repetition (because... I study Japanese)
<br>Templater (here's my templates btw):


<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<br>.

<br>Syncthing (with Syncthing-fork on my Android phone, since it was discontinued)
<br>Git (for when I don't want to manually upload this)
<br>Periodic Notes (so I can keep a calendar on here as well as physically)


<br><br>If you have any suggestions on what I should research/make tutorials on/etc etc, don't hesitate to contact me <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" target="_blank">here</a>, or on my <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" target="_blank">discord</a>. And, no, before you ask, I probably won't respond. Feel free to share the website with anyone and everyone you think might need some mental help free information!<br>And, if you need a place to begin, I'd recommend <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="00 - Maps of Content/Yggdrasil" data-href="00 - Maps of Content/Yggdrasil" href="00-maps-of-content/yggdrasil.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Yggdrasil</a>.]]></description><link>readme.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">README.md</guid><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 04:23:29 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
