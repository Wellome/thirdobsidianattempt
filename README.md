# Welcome!
Hello, and welcome back to another attempt at making a website. Whether you know me, or not, enjoy the slew of information now available... when I remember to update the website. Right now, I will **aim** to update this once a week. If you notice gaps in my folders, that's because I excluded them. For my vault exporting, I use [this plugin](obsidian://show-plugin?id=webpage-html-export). If you have the time, check them out! I majorly recommend them.

# Information about me
I'm not one to put *too* much information about myself on the internet, but as of the 1st of January, 2025, here is what I use for Obsidian:
- PC:
	- Intel i5 4460s (yes, it's old) with the iGPU
	- Samsung SyncMaster 713n
	- aiwa Japan 1080p 75hz monitor
	- Some Big W mouse, keyboard and mouse pad Avengers set
	- Arch Linux (i use arch btw)
	- KDE Plasma & Hyprland (if you don't know what those are, don't worry)
		- (speaking of Arch, i'm in the middle of making a tutorial on here for anyone who wants to use it, it's not uploaded yet tho)
- Obsidian:
	- Webpage HTML Export (which I linked earlier, no I won't link every plugin here)
	- Dataview (if you use Obsidian, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE use this)
	- Excalidraw (not overly useful, but has its niches)
	- Calendar (who the hell *doesn't* use a calendar)
	- Spaced Repetition (because... I study Japanese)
	- Templater (here's my templates btw):
```dataview
list
from "99 - Meta/00 - Templates"
```
- .
	- Syncthing (with Syncthing-fork on my Android phone, since it was discontinued)
	- Git (for when I *don't* want to manually upload this)
	- Periodic Notes (so I can keep a calendar on here as well as physically)

# Last notes
If you have any suggestions on what I should research/make tutorials on/etc etc, don't hesitate to contact me [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), or on my [discord](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ). And, no, before you ask, I probably won't respond. Feel free to share the website with anyone and everyone you think might need some ~~mental help~~ free information!

And, if you need a place to begin, I'd recommend [[00 - Maps of Content/Yggdrasil|Yggdrasil]].
